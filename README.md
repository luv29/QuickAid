# QwikAid â€“ AI-Driven Roadside Assistance & Emergency Support Platform

![banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/MindBend_Hackathon_2025-Odoo_Track-blueviolet)  
Picture a comprehensive roadside assistance system that jumps into action when you break down on a remote national highway as dusk falls and your phone signal fades. It consists of an intelligent, agentic AI that evaluates your situation and arranges for assistance, along with live tracking to determine your location, an SOS button for immediate rescue, and offline capabilities to keep you covered even in signal-dead zones, ensuring that every commuter feels safe and supported no matter how far they roam.

## Architecture Overview

### Agentic AI Flow
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/185387e7-b4d0-459b-b670-aa36b64fa6b3)
* User sends a query to the Backend via API.
* Backend forwards it to the MCP Client, which prompts the LLM.
* LLM processes the prompt, interacts with the MCP Server, and uses tools (e.g., GPS Tracking, SOS Emergency).
* LLM returns a JSON response to the MCP Client.
* Backend delivers the response to the User.

### Real-time assistance matching
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/588cb926-50ed-418f-9ceb-7e3bde4a9ba5)

* The client app captures the user's location and sends it to the backend via HTTP POST.
* The backend queries a geo-indexed MongoDB to find the nearest garage.
* Garage details are returned in JSON and displayed on a map using React Native Maps.
* Assistance vehicles send live location via WebSocket for real-time tracking.
* The backend relays vehicle location updates to the client app.

### Offline Support Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f96261e-19a0-4cf4-b624-1d82a605e6b7)

* App uses geo-hashing to encode driver's GPS location for efficient proximity searches.
* Ride start triggers continuous location tracking and geo-hash storage in local DB.
* Nearby service center data (geo-hash + contact) is cached locally and refreshed online.
* In offline mode, app compares current geo-hash with cached data to find nearby centers.
